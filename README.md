# std
Some sas and python samples and some videos that demonstrates a kind of deliverable.

## Welcome to my github samples code - STD

STD ia an acronym for Santander which is the bank where I've been working since 2015.

At 20217 - In the business area responsible for the compensation plan of entire sales force of Brazil, I've lead the team which set the goals up, and brought the transformation with new processes and the use of Sas to code.

These sas files are some samples of code that I've coded:
1. assets_goals.sas
2. liabilities_goals.sas
3. mediation_tests_goals.sas

At 2020 - In microfinance area, I've lead two agile teams which brought the App for sales force team which lift the business up to scalable business case in the bank and also brought the interactive reports for managers, an excelent time-to-market sample.

The py files are samples of codes that I did to sumarize all the assets information, i separete these because they are good samples of object oriented code in python:
1. managerPagamentos.py
2. main.py (the Helper Classes that it uses i though not necessary to bring here).

Here is the print Screen for this report:

At the same time, as I was leading the transformation in this digital era, I've made some videos to better comunicate the new changes to the sales teams.

The videos that I've made by my own (my own voice in the Audio was recorded using ProTools and the videos that I've captured by my own and sequenced using Final Cut Pro):

1.App Prospera Tansformation.mp4
2.Accounting Transformation - Qlik - 1st part.mp4
3.Accounting Transformation - Qlik - 2nd part.mp4

Nowadays I'm working in another new transformation project.
